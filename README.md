# Car Reservation System

## Scenario:
The Car Reservation System allows customers to reserve cars for rental. Users can browse available cars, select the date and time for the rental, and make a reservation. Admins can add, update, or remove cars from the system and manage reservations.

## Design Paradigm:
The system will have two types of users: **Customers** and **Admins**.

- **Customers**:
  - Browse available cars.
  - Filter cars by type, brand, or availability.
  - Reserve a car for a specific time period.
  - View their current and past reservations.

- **Admins**:
  - Add new cars to the system.
  - Update or remove existing cars.
  - View all reservations.
  - Manage reservation statuses (confirm, cancel, or modify).

## Expected Output:
- **For Customers**:
  - Ability to browse and filter cars.
  - Reserve a car with specific start and end dates.
  - View a list of current reservations and reservation history.
- **For Admins**:
  - Ability to add, update, or remove cars.
  - View and manage all reservations.

  - Methods: `makeReservation()`, `viewReservations()`.

- **Admin** (extends `User`):
  - Attributes: `adminId`.
  - Methods: `addCar()`, `updateCar()`, `removeCar()`, `manageReservations()`.

- **Car**:
  - Attributes: `carId`, `model`, `brand`, `carType`, `availableFrom`, `availableTo`.
  - Methods: `isAvailable()`, `getCarDetails()`.

- **Reservation**:

### 2. Data Structures:
- **List<Car>**: To store the list of available cars.
- **List<Reservation>**: To store all reservations.
- LINQ can be used to filter cars based on availability, brand, or type.

### 3. GUI Features:
- **Login Screen**: A login system for both customers and admins.
- **Customer Dashboard**:
  - Browse cars with filtering options (brand, type, availability).
  - View current reservations and past reservation history.
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Add, update, or remove cars from the system.
  - View and manage all reservations.

### 4. Data Source:
- Use a **database** (SQLite or any relational DB) to store car information and reservations.
- **Optional**: File-based storage if a database isnâ€™t needed.

### 5. Internationalization (I18N and L10N):
- Support for **two languages** (e.g., English and French).
- Use **ResourceBundle** for storing translated strings.
- The UI should switch between languages based on user preference.

### 6. Test-Driven Development (TDD):
- Write unit tests for key methods like `makeReservation()`, `addCar()`, and `isAvailable()`.
- Ensure the test coverage includes checking for availability conflicts and proper reservation creation.
